Having been an officer for a student org in my university in the midst of the pandemic, I was aware of the struggles of virtual classes. It was easy to lose motivation as most students were isolated from their peers. To combat this a little, I made a bot named Pockychu for my organization's Discord. Pockychu's main function is to give a motivational message, and a cute happy gif from Giphy to those who need it. :)
